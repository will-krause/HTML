        I’m a writer, creator, trainer, and experienced software professional with a background in journalism, which, at its heart, is storytelling, interviewing, and communication. Through my many interests and experiences, I’ve learned that I possess an aptitude for communicating technical or complex subjects to others; that is, cutting through the jargon and focusing on the important concepts behind tasks, processes, and products. I’m not satisfied unless others understand what I’m trying to tell them.

I work with a complex SQL-based relational database, and understand the capabilities and business logic that are available in this type of architecture.
